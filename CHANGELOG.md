- DNS server outbound egress lockdown (firewalld dns-egress policy, inert by default via DNS_EGRESS_ENFORCE)
- Added second proxy node proxy-02.lan (192.168.150.251 / 2a02:8010:61d5:150::251); renamed proxy.lan to proxy-01.lan.
- Added 01.proxy.markridgwell.com and 02.proxy.markridgwell.com records for pinning to a specific proxy node.
- Added reverse DNS (PTR) zones for the internal 192.168.x.0/24 and 2a02:8010:61d5:x::/64 subnets, populated from the existing forward zones
### Fixed
- Fixed typo in `zones/lan.db`: `docker-tegistry` renamed to `docker-registry` (`192.168.150.202`).
- Corrected `monitoring.lan` IP in `zones/lan.db` from `192.168.150.135` to `192.168.150.134`.
- Egress ipset refresh no longer flaps on NAT64 spelling differences, and aborted update/refresh runs can no longer strand firewall runtime state behind permanent config
### Changed
- Removed the legacy repository `hosts` file workflow; zone files in `zones/` are now the source of truth.
- Widened the allowed IPv6 firewall network from 2a02:8010:61d5::/64 to 2a02:8010:61d5::/48 to cover all subnets, not just subnet 0
- Switched Technitium recursion ACL from AllowOnlyForPrivateNetworks to an explicit network ACL including 2a02:8010:61d5::/48, since public IPv6 addresses are never classified as private
- Renumbered dns-01 through dns-04 from 192.168.42.251-254 to 192.168.42.101-104, added dns-05 (192.168.42.105), and added AAAA records (2a02:8010:61d5:42::101-105) for all five in lan.db and dns.lan.db
- Removed stale hagezi block-list URLs from docker-compose - hagezi was deliberately disabled in the live config
- install now runs update at the end so a fresh ./install produces a fully running system
- Egress lockdown is now enforced by default - set DNS_EGRESS_ENFORCE=false for observation mode
- Simplified egress firewall internals - single log-only catch-all with the policy target as the sole enforcement knob (kernel log prefix is now always dns-egress-unmatched:), shared rule helper, conditional reloads
- All 36 services previously fronted by the single proxy now resolve to both proxy-01 and proxy-02 addresses (DNS round-robin), and the internal proxy egress firewall rule allows both.
